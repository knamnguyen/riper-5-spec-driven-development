based on @0-sample-duma-context.md 

and the sample project in @0-sample-duma 

i want to create exactly the same app - with the same features and data BUT in neobrutalism and gumroad minimalist, rounded, easy to the eye, modern, friendly, creative, cool, slay

Tech stack wise - changes:
- use pnpm instead of npm 
- I want to use nextjs latest (app not page router)
- Tailwind css 4 (pls update as the current project is old
- React router and React query latest version please (search the web for this for new patterns)

/generate-plan 

goal: fully functional prototype with mock data - can be run and tested in the localhost site

this is a complex task so split into phases
